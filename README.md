# Bubbles

Bubbles lets you create types with that behave the same way as if you declared them in C++ or other full-featured OOP languages. One of the biggest annoyances with JavaScript is the lack of a private scope within an object. The longer the inheritance chain, the harder it is to come up with unique names for things, and the easier it is to clash names with a parent class creating nonintuitive, buggy behavior.
